# To The Moon!
## Travel to the mysterious and treacherous moon dimension!

### About:
To The Moon is a mod that adds several moon-related items including the moon dimension itself.

### Functionality:
In order to be able to make a moon portal, you first need to obtain Moon Stone. Moon Stone Ore generates around the area where Iron and Coal Ore meet. To be able to craft Moon Stone, you will need 4 Raw Moon Stone. You can obtain Raw Moon Stone via mining Moon Stone Ore (Stone pickaxe or higher required). Once you have at least 10 Moon Stone, you will also need to craft a Moon Dimension Portal Ignitor. This can be crafted with 1 Iron Ingot and 1 Moon Stone Shard. To get 1 Moon Stone Shard, you need to smelt 1 Raw Moon Stone. Once you have built the portal and lit it, you can now access the moon dimension! (Read up on more of the functionality via the wiki)
